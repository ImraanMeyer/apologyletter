        <!-- My cheesy apology and request for taking out  -->
        <p>
            My dearest Beloved.. I am so sorry for all the stupid
            things I have said and done. You are the most amazing
            girl I have ever met, and the best girlfriend any guy could want.
            You are truly beautiful on the inside and out.
        </p>
            Thinking about all of this and how much I hurt the best
            girlfriend in the world just makes me cry. I do realize though
            it isn't close to the hurt you must have felt from the pain
            I caused in your heart.
        <p>
            If you do find it in your heart to forgive me,
            I would like to take you out and spoil you rotten!
            First I want to take my time and prepare your favourite dish.
        </p>
